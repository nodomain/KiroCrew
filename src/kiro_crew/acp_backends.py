"""Which ACP backends this build can serve — the one place that decides.

The question this module owns is **capability**: can this build drive the harness
at all? The public edition registers kiro-cli and KAS; an edition plugin adds its
own from ``ProviderRegistry.register_acp_backends`` by calling
:func:`register_selectable_backend`, the structural twin of
``publish_provider.register_provider``.

A LEAF module on purpose. ``kiro_crew/acp/__init__.py`` imports the ACP client and
runtime, so reaching ``kiro_crew.acp.types`` executes that package init and lands
back in ``config.loader`` — the cycle ``_normalize_acp_backend`` used to defer for.
That cycle is why the selectable list used to be a **literal in three unrelated
places** (the loader's ``acp_backend`` field metadata, the dashboard's PATCH
allowlist, and ``acp.types``) with a drift test standing in for a code owner: none
of the three could import the others. Nothing here imports ``kiro_crew.acp``,
``kiro_crew.config`` or ``kiro_crew.platform``, so all three now derive from this
module — and a plugin-registered backend reaches the dashboard without a core
edit, which a literal could never do.

Whether a registered backend may be selected on a *given deployment* is a separate
question (an enterprise policy bounding the fleet to one harness). It is
deliberately NOT answered here: it needs a governance ceiling, resolving a ceiling
reaches ``current_context()``, and that call's lazy branch loads config — so asking
it from :func:`resolve_selected_backend`, which runs inside
``KiroCrewConfig.load()``, re-enters that load and recurses. Keeping this module
capability-only is what makes the load path safe.

    THE single gate, in the one place the pre-registry code already gated: called
    from ``_normalize_acp_backend`` on the way out of ``config.json``. What changed
    is only what it reads — the registry instead of a frozen literal — so the
    coercion behaviour is unchanged from before the registry existed. The Kiro
    construction path deliberately gains no second check: harness-parity H13 keeps
    that path free of conditionals added in service of an adapter, and a check there
    could not fire anyway, since ``AgentConfig`` is built in exactly one place and
    its ``acp_backend`` is never reassigned.

    Runs inside ``KiroCrewConfig.load()``, so it must stay free of anything that
    reads the platform context: ``current_context()``'s lazy branch loads config,
    so a lookup here re-enters the very load that called it and recurses until the
    stack ends — and a broad ``except`` around it does not save you, it converts
    the crash into a silent wrong answer. Reading only the registry keeps it safe.

    An unselectable or unrecognized value — a backend this build did not register, a
    typo, or the non-string shapes a hand-edited ``config.json`` can hold — degrades
    to the default with the reason in the log rather than propagating: ``AcpProvider``
    rejects an unknown backend by raising, and startup refusing with a reason is the
    contract (harness-parity H3).

    An edition that registers a backend must do so before the first config load; the
    registry is read here, not cached, so ordering is the edition's to get right.
