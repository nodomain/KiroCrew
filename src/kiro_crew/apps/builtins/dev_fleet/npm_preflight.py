"""Pre-merge installability probe for Dev Fleet's Pull+Build frontend half.

``npm ci`` DELETES ``node_modules`` before it installs. So a registry that
refuses one package turns a sync into damage rather than a no-op: the tree is
emptied, the run aborts mid-reify, and the checkout is left with new source, a
new lockfile, and no frontend dependencies at all. Re-pressing Pull+Build
repeats the deletion.

This module answers the one question that prevents that, BEFORE the merge
lands: *can the incoming lockfile be installed at all?* It reads the lockfile
out of the fetched ref (``git show``) rather than the working tree, so it can
run between ``fetch`` and ``merge`` — the only point where the new lockfile is
already knowable and nothing has been applied yet. A refusal there costs
nothing, because ``fetch`` only moves remote refs.

Two things it deliberately is NOT:

* It is NOT a registry auth check. A dead registry token is invisible to a
  build whose packages are all in npm's local cache, because cacache retrieval
  is integrity-addressed: a tarball already on disk satisfies its lockfile
  entry with no network and no credentials. A ``npm ping``-style probe would
  therefore fail while the very install it guards would have succeeded — it
  would block good syncs and teach operators to ignore it. Asking
  "is this installable" instead is both narrower and correct, and it is
  registry-agnostic: it holds for a public registry, a private mirror, or an
  air-gapped cache alike.
* It does NOT run the package tree's lifecycle scripts (``--ignore-scripts``).
  The probe exists to answer a question, not to execute the worktree's install
  hooks a second time; skipping them also keeps the probe strictly less
  privileged than the step it guards.

It performs a REAL install into a disposable directory rather than
``npm ci --dry-run``, and that is not a preference. A dry run does not attempt
retrieval at all: against a lockfile pinning a tarball that 404s, measured,
``npm ci --dry-run --ignore-scripts`` exits 0 and reports "added 1 package"
while the same command without ``--dry-run`` exits 1 on the missing tarball. A
dry run would therefore pass exactly the case this module exists to catch, so
the probe has to fetch. The cost of that honesty is one script-free install per
sync -- seconds against a warm cache -- which is cheap next to the emptied
``node_modules`` it prevents.

The flags otherwise MIRROR the real step exactly. A probe that resolves
differently from the install is worse than no probe: it either passes what will
fail, or fails what would have worked. ``--no-audit``/``--no-fund`` are the only
additions, and neither participates in resolution.

The distinct exit codes do NOT drive a cross-process protocol: the runner only
tests non-zero, and nothing outside this module reads which code came back. What
the classification is for is :func:`explain` -- turning a failure into one
registry-neutral sentence the dashboard can show instead of npm's log-file
pointer. Keeping the codes separate is what makes that sentence specific, and
what lets a caller tell a host condition (a full scratch filesystem) from a
lockfile that genuinely cannot be installed.
